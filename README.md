This is my final project for CS50 SQL course.
It's a SQLite database for a (fictitious) RPG card video game called Battle Card Campus.
I've included:

* Design document
* Schema script
* Sample queries

To create the database, run the schema script in a SQLite program.
The design document is in MD (markdown) language but I've also provided it in PDF.
